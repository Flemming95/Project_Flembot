# Configuration for ros_gz_sim bridge and simulator behavior.
# Edit these values to customize how ros_gz_sim is launched.
#
# This example includes a minimal bridge configuration and placeholders
# for other ros_gz_sim options. Consult ros_gz_sim launch file docs
# for full option names and semantics.

bridge:
  # name of the bridge node used by ros_gz_bridge/ros_gz_bridge
  name: bridge

# Example: transport and QoS settings (placeholder)
transport:
  # 'ros2' is commonly used for ros_gz_bridge
  type: ros2

# physics / world settings (placeholders)
physics:
  max_step_size: 0.001
  real_time_update_rate: 1000

# Additional parameters can be added here to match the
# DeclareLaunchArgument names expected by the ros_gz_sim launch.
# For example, if the launch expects `sdf_path` or `sdf_model`,
# add them here and then pass the appropriate launch-argument name.
